# 🛡️ Malicious Input Classifier for Web Forms

A machine learning-powered application that classifies user-submitted form inputs as:
- 🟢 Benign
- 🔴 SQL Injection (SQLi)
- 🟠 Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

Built with **scikit-learn** and deployed via **Streamlit**, this project demonstrates a lightweight, real-time defense layer against common web input attacks.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

Web applications often receive malicious inputs through form fields such as:
- Login forms
- Comment boxes
- Search fields

These inputs can result in:
- 🛑 Data breaches
- 🔐 Account takeovers
- 🖼️ Website defacement

This project aims to mitigate such threats by building a machine learning classifier that detects **SQLi**, **XSS**, or **Benign** inputs in real-time.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- 🔎 Analyze and extract key features from form inputs.
- 🧠 Train a machine learning model to detect attack types.
- 🖥️ Deploy a web-based dashboard for real-time and bulk prediction.
- 🚫 Prevent potential malicious inputs before backend processing.
